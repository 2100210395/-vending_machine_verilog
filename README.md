# -vending_machine_verilog
A fully functional Verilog-based vending machine designed using a Finite State Machine (FSM). Supports three product options (â‚¹25, â‚¹50, â‚¹75), handles overpayment with change return, detects underpayment, and allows multiple consecutive purchases. Includes a comprehensive testbench and timing-accurate waveform validation
ðŸ§¾ Project Overview
SmartVend-FSM is a Verilog-based vending machine project built around a Finite State Machine. It simulates a real-world vending machine that:
- Offers 3 products priced at â‚¹25, â‚¹50, and â‚¹75
- Accepts user input for product selection and money insertion
- Dispenses products and returns change for overpayment
- Rejects purchases with insufficient funds
- Allows repeated purchases of the same product via a buy_more control signal
